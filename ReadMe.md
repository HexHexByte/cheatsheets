### what the hell is this?
Just like [DRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_refresh), human memory needs to be refreshed to prevent decay.
These cheatsheets are for quick brush-ups and I'll be adding more as time goes by.

### motivation
The idea is to have all of the notes in one place that can be accessed quickly. Also, I'm hoping this will solve the fragmentation
caused by use of several different note-taking apps and possible vendor lock-in issues by those apps.
